# Spinwise – An AI-Powered Spotify Companion

## The Problem with Music Recommendations

If you've ever had Spotify recommend emo tracks from 2015 you'd rather forget... you'll understand exactly why I created Spinwise.

## What is Spinwise?

Spinwise is an AI-powered music recommendation tool that connects to your Spotify account and gives you **actually good suggestions** based on how you're feeling. Not just what you listened to 7 years ago.

It analyses your:

- Top tracks
- Favourite artists
- Genre preferences
- Specific playlists

## How It Works

With Spinwise, you can:

1. Choose your current mood
2. Select how you want recommendations explained:
   - Emotional analysis
   - Short & sweet descriptions
   - Vibe-driven explanations
3. Generate playlists you'll actually enjoy

## The Tech Stack

I built Spinwise using:

```plaintext
frontend: Next.js 15
styling: TailwindCSS
ai: OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo
musicData: Spotify Web API
hosting: VPS with PM2
qualityControl: Lighthouse GitHub Actions

```

## Current Status

Spinwise is currently invite-only while I wait for Spotify Extension approval (they love to take their time getting around to reviewing it...). If you want to test it, I'll happily add you manually.

## From Procrastination to Product

This has been one of my favourite projects ever. It started as a way to dodge dissertation work, and now it's something people are actually using (and loving).

> What began as a caffeine-fuelled side project became a working AI music recommendation app that people genuinely enjoy using.

## Try It Out

If you're tired of algorithmic recommendations that miss the mark, give Spinwise a try. It's music discovery that actually understands your taste.
